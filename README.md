# pftcftcalc2023

Some of you may already be familiar with the Excel version of the PFT/CFT NAVMC that has been floating around S3 shops for over a decade. The original creator retired, and with the new testing requirements, the Excel sheet has become obsolete. Recently, I completely revamped the Excel workbook.
•	plank scoring system
•	VBA coding
•	Corrected score sheets.
I'm not sure if anybody still uses the Excel version, but it's available for your use. This is the Beta version, so if you find any issues or discrepancies, please let me know. I'll continue to refine the product when time becomes available.
For the technical Marines:
I coded in VBA to minimize the redundancy and make it a lot easier for changes in the future.
Update (5/5/2023): Corrected formatting issues. (ver 1.1)
Update (5/8/2023): Corrected partial PFT/CFT scoring, date formatting on NAVMC (ver 1.2)
